LOGIN.PHP -- User can login on this page. They can also choose to signup, or if
they forgot their password they can request a reset link.

      login.php --> ../REG/signup.php           (new user sign up)
      login.php --> /loginscript.php            (log existing users in)
      login.php --> ../Forgot/reset.php         (send reset password to user)

LOGINSCRIPT.PHP -- This page is VERY important for backend functionality. Here,
user login data is verified. If it is correct, user data is pulled from the DB
and loaded into a session. USER status is set to "LOGGED_IN", which will affect
access to other pages.

*** NOTE *** if user data is not set on this page, the other pages will not be accessable
also, PHP scripts that require SESSION data will not work.

      loginscript.php --> ../Main/main.php      (if login success)
      loginscript.php --> /login.php            (if login failed, allow up to 3 tries per 12 hours)


LOGOUT.PHP -- if a user wants to log out, all session data is reset and they are
sent back to login.php

      logout.php --> /login.php                 (if user logs out)
