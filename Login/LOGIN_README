signup, or if they forgot their password they can request a reset
link.

   ../Reg/signup.php   (new user sign up)
   /loginscript.php    (log existing users in)
   ../Forgot/reset.php (send reset password to user)


LOGINSCRIPT.PHP -- This page is VERY important for backend
functionality. Here, user login data is verified. If it is correct,
user data is pulled from the DB and loaded into a session. USER status
is set to "LOGGED_IN", which will affect access to other pages.

*** NOTE *** if user data is not set on this page, the other pages
will not be accessible also, PHP scripts that require SESSION data
will not work.

   /login.php        (if login failed, allow up to 3 tries per 12 hours)


(move this to the account folder)
LOGOUT.PHP -- if a user wants to log out, all session data is reset and they are
sent back to login.php
