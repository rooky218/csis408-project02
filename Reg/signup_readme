SIGNUP.PHP -- this page collects USERNAME, EMAIL, and PASSWORD, these three elements are REQUIRED to create a profile. This is the only mandatory page during the signup process.

SIGNUP_PROFILE.PHP -- this page collects FIRSTNAME, LASTNAME, PHONE NUMBER, and ZIP. This page can be skipped. Information is not mandatory, however to have a complete profile it is recommended. there should be a prompt if someone tries to skip this.
