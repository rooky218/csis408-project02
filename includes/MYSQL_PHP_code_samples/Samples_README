These are the sections of code that I have written that access
the database.

DBLOGIN.PHP -- this page is critical. There should be two of these.
one file is for our localhost login. The other is for the website.
Since the login cannot be the same for these two databases, include
both files in the DB folder.

in the file, the variable $my_db is set, which includes the login
credentials

On any page where we write code that accesses the database,
we much use the line:
    require(../includes/PHP/DB/dblogin.php);
this will force the page to load the login credentials for the databases

When examining the code (lets say from loginscript.php) the
database is logged into on line 15 when the variable $my_db
is called.

The line $r = @mysqli_query($my_db, $q); will run any query that is
stored in $q

parameter $my_db contains login credentials
parameter $q has the prebuilt query
and the new variable $r is where the results are stored.
once the results are pulled, we break apart the array with the command
$mysquli_fetch_array($r, MYSQLI_ASSOC);
